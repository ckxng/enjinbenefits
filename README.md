# Enjin Benefits

[Enjin](http://www.enjin.com), a Minecraft community hosting provider, 
provides a number of useful features for server operators.  One of these 
features is to track points and manage donations for a server.  Unfortunately, 
Enjin does not yet support 1.7.10, but they do provide an API.  This is a very 
simple mod that will allow me to use Enjin points on my 1.7.10 Forge server.
